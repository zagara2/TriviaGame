# Timed Garfield Trivia

## What is it?

**This site is home to the hardest, sassiest (and perhaps the only) Garfield quiz you'll ever take!**

Upon clicking the start button, the player is shown a trivia form with 10 multiple choice questions. Players are prevented from picking more than one answer per question. The player has a limited amount of time to finish the quiz, displayed on the countdown timer at the top of the form. The game ends when the time runs out, or when the player hits "submit answers" - whichever comes first. The page then reveals the number of questions that the player answered correctly and incorrectly, as well as the number of unanswered questions, and a button which gives the option to take the quiz again. 


The site is currently deployed at https://zagara2.github.io/TriviaGame/ .

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript (in particular, Javascript timers)
* JQuery

## Browser and Screen Compatibility

### Browser Tests

The site has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. It works perfectly in all of them.

Plans to test on Safari are upcoming.

### Screen Compatibility Tests

The site is best viewed on a small to moderately large desktop or notebook (between 1280x800 and 1680x1050), but looks decent on essentially any modern device's screen resolution. This includes both a 10" and 12" Netbook, a 13" and 15" notebook, 19"-24" desktops, Kindle Fire, Asus Nexus 7, iPad and iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy tab, Microsoft Surface Pro, iPhone 3 and up (including iPhone 6-7 plus), Galaxy S2 and up, LG G 3-5, and 480p, 720p and 1080p televisions. 

The font size could stand to be made a bit smaller on mobile, but the game is still easily playable.

When the page is loaded properly, it should look like this:

**(top half; the rest of the page is visible if one keeps scrolling.)**

## Future Plans for Improvement

* Use media queries to do a bit more optimization on the mobile layout so that mobile users will not have to scroll as much.
